# Displacement Measuring with PMW3360
This code is designed for testing and fine tunning the optical sensor PMW3360 for accurately measuring displacements and keeping track of its position inside a two-dimensional coordinate system. As well as controlling a mobile robot through four stepper motors and Mechanum wheels.
